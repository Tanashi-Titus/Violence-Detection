In this project, I will introduce the project to detect violence situation

Model:
+ We use ResNet50 to extract the feature of image from the video
+ Next, the model will transfer the feature map to LSTM to classify where is violence and non-violence

Dataset:
+ We use a half of dataset from team Vaidehei from Kaggle, just use a half of folder violence, and full of non-violence

How to use code:
+ We run this project on google colab (have GPU)
+ Just change your path of dataset to extract frame, feature of dataset
+ Train model
+ Test with your own video

Good luck for all you guys, Titus
